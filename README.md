# UFOs
## Overview of Project: 
The purpose of this analysis is to organize the UFO data and to give users the ability to filter the data for first 5 columns of the table. In order to do this, there is a user interface on the website that users are able to see the data as it is being filtered. 

## Results: 
In the Filter Search section of the website, there are 5 filters that are connected to the table. When the user types into the filters and presses enter, then they are able to see the table with the selected filters as shown in figure 1. They are also able to select multiple filters at the same time as shown in figure 2.

## Summary: 
One drawback of this new design is that if there were thousands of data for value in the table and you wanted to specify more, it would take a while to load the first filter of the table. For example, the user wanted to filter for the city bonita and the duration of the UFO sighting but there was a lot of sightings at bonita. It would take a while for the website to load the filter because there would be a lot to filter for. The first recommendation is to have a button for all of the filters, so that the user can input all the filter requirements before the website starts filtering. The second recommendation is show a limited amount of data when the users first get on to the website then with the selected filters on show range of data set that the users wanted. For example: show 50 of 150 rows and the user can expand how much they want to see.
